# Split
A time management tool inspired by speedrunning software, designed to help paint a picture of how your time is spent, and how long things take.

# Overview
To begin, start a session. Whenever you complete a task, name the task, select a category, and click 'Split.' Time spent since the start of the session will be indicated. 

If you change your mind, you can click on a split to update its name and category. You can continue adding splits until your work session is complete, when you can click 'End.' From there, you can start a new session if you like.

Statistics for each session are displayed at the bottom, and are updated as new splits are added.
